## Introduction to Dart
Dart has 9 Data types
1. String
2. Numbers - Integers(Whole numbers) and Double(floated)
3. Booleans
4. Lists
5. Maps
6. Sets
7. Runes
8. Symbols
9. The value 'null'

## Difference between var and dynamic
1. Always aim to assign your variable the right data type
2. Use var when you know it can only hold one type of data
3. Use dynamic if the variable can hold any type of data
